The Task 2 data consists of ellipsis constructions in Russian. The task for an NLP pipeline or an LLM is to guess the position and full form of the elided words, phrases, and other content.



More details about the [Hoosier Ellipsis Corpus] can be found on the [NLP-Lab] pages. The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dcavar/hoosierellipsiscorpus) contains links to other languages and useful code and scripts for data processing.

This repo contains the Ukrainian Ellipsis Sub-corpus of THEC.

Consult the [data format specification](https://nlp-lab.org/ellipsis/data_format) for details about the structure of the files and the annotation standard used.
